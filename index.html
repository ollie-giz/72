    <img id="imageofcanteen" src="Dobbies_Canteen_931 (1).JPG"
    <h4>The all saints canteen is a very important part of any middle school enviornment. Canteens are an essential component of any middle school environment, providing a space where students can socialize, eat, and recharge. They offer a variety of nutritious meal options, catering to students' diverse dietary needs and preferences. Moreover, canteens are instrumental in promoting healthy eating habits and teaching students about balanced diets. Additionally, canteens often serve as a hub for school events, fostering a sense of community and school spirit. By providing students with a comfortable and inviting space to take a break from their academic pursuits, canteens help promote overall wellbeing and contribute to a positive school experience.</h4>

  <h3> All Saints has recently added a new wellbeing system.</h3>
  <span>
    <img id="imageofcanteen" src="Wellbeingjpg"
    <h4>Middle school is a critical period of development for students, and prioritizing their wellbeing is crucial for their academic success and overall growth. Adolescents at this age experience significant physical, emotional, and cognitive changes, and providing them with a supportive and nurturing environment can help them navigate these transitions effectively. When students feel physically and emotionally safe, supported, and engaged, they are more likely to participate in class, form positive relationships with their peers and teachers, and perform better academically. By focusing on middle school wellbeing, schools can set their students up for success both in and outside of the classroom, promoting lifelong health and happiness.</h4>
